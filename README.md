# points via OME-NGFF

Experiment in evaluating storage of points (2D, 2.5D, or 3D point clouds) via OME-NGFF:
- Definition of the storage approach
- Prototype implementation
- TODO: Utilities to convert SpatialData Points elements to this format
- TODO: Benchmarking of common operations (existing Parquet-based format vs. this OME-NGFF-based format)
